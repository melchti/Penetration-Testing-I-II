# Penetration-Testing-I-II

This week, I learned about pen testing and the steps to becoming a pentester, and then performed some basic reconnaissance using OSINT tools.

I explored each stage of the pen testing process:

1.	Planning and Reconnaissance
2.	Scanning
3.	Exploitation
4.	Post Exploitation
5.	Reporting

Homework 16


In this assignment, you will work as a recently hired security analyst at Altoro Mutual, a banking service.

•	Concerned about their online presence and the security of their website demo.testfire.net, they have hired you to evaluate the security posture of their operations.

•	As a holder very sensitive customer and financial data, Altoro Mutual is worried malicious actors compromising their website anf gaining this information.


You are tasked with performing website enumeration, discovery, and vulnerability detection. Because this engagement is non-invasive, you will not try to hack into their system. Rather, you will discover any potential vulnerabilities or leaks that the company should be worried about.

Please note throughout this assignment, you will target a website named "Altoro Mutual" located at demo.testfire.net. Altoro Mutual was designed by IBM, a company that designs both hardware and software for computers. Their website demo.testfire.net was specifically designed to detect web application vulnerabilities.



Homework 17

In this activity, you will play the role of an independent penetration tester hired by GoodCorp Inc. to perform security tests against their CEO’s workstation.

The CEO claims to have passwords that are long and complex and therefore unhackable.

You are tasked with gaining access to the CEO's computer and using a Meterpreter session to search for two files that contain the strings recipe and seceretfile.

The deliverable for this engagement will be in the form of a report labeled Report.docx.


The scope of this engagement is limited to the CEO's workstation only. You are not permitted to scan any other IP addresses or exploit anything other than the CEO's IP address.


The CEO has a busy schedule and cannot have the computer offline for an extended period of time. Therefore, denial of service and brute force attacks are prohibited.


After you gain access to the CEO’s computer, you may read and access any file, but you cannot delete them. Nor are you allowed to make any configurations changes to the computer.


Since you've already been provided access to the network, OSINT won't be necessary.
